Destructible Terrain Space Bullet Hell Shooter Demo, built with the Three.js game engine as a cross-platform browser-based proof of concept.   Players pilot a spacecraft and fire two types of ammunition to destroy mineral voxels on the planet's surface. Once destroyed, mineral voxels shatter into debris, exposing buried enemy facilities.
